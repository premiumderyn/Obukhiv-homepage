Hi there!

I`m so happy to introduce my very first solo project - Hometown Obukhiv. 
It`s just a simple website that familiarizes you with my native city.
Here I grew up, studied, and am living right now.
On the site, you`ll find some facts and information that i believe will be interesting for you.

Thanks for being here!
Please, don`t judge me for my first design website)
